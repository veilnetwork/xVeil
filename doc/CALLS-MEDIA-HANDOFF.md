# Calls media handoff

Date: 2026-07-09.

This note preserves the last known working context after the local scratchpad was
removed from git and cleaned from disk.

## Current state

- Calls over veil Phase 4 video is implemented and was device/user verified:
  bidirectional audio and video over the 2-hop onion media datagram channel.
- Recent committed line includes macOS camera discovery, route-change crash
  hardening, heartbeat/media-aware liveness, in-call mic/camera toggles, non-
  blocking macOS media start, stale-route media self-heal, off-isolate node id
  FFI, and low-latency media queue tuning.
- Latest superproject commits around this line:
  - `2d036eb` - bump veil for low-latency media queue.
  - `e4b5e19` - retire stale durable call signals.
  - `fa2a1c7` - mac media start no longer freezes UI on accept.
  - `f0bd6aa` - self-heal desktop->phone media when channel opened early.
- Local uncommitted follow-up:
  - `third_party/veil/flutter/veil_flutter/lib/src/client.dart`: ordinary
    `AppHandle.send()` now runs `veil_send` on a worker isolate. This removes
    the call signaling path (offer/answer/heartbeat over `MessagingService`) from
    Flutter's UI isolate; previously it used `Future(() { ... })`, which still
    ran the synchronous Rust `block_on` FFI on the same isolate.
  - `third_party/veil/crates/veilclient-ffi/src/lib.rs`: media datagram outbound
    queue is split into high-priority audio/RTCP/unknown packets (32) and VP8
    video RTP packets (96). This preserves normal VP8 keyframe bursts without
    putting audio behind a long video FIFO.
  - `third_party/veil/flutter/veil_media/src/veil_transport_shim.{h,cc}`:
    inbound datagrams copied into WebRTC's network queue are now bounded to 256
    pending packets or 4 MiB. Overload drops are logged, and `Stop()` waits
    briefly for already posted inbound tasks to drain before destruction.

## 2026-07-09 follow-up verification

- Rebuilt macOS native media and veil FFI libraries:
  - `third_party/veil/flutter/veil_media/macos/Frameworks/libveil_media.dylib`
  - `third_party/veil/target/release/libveilclient_ffi.dylib`
  - `third_party/hidden-volume/target/release/libhidden_volume_ffi.dylib`
- Re-signed the debug macOS app and reset Camera/Microphone TCC for
  `network.veil.xveil`.
- Android `libveil_media.so` was not rebuilt in this pass because the local
  Docker/Colima `webrtc` profile socket was unavailable. The connected phone
  still participated in the real call with its existing app build.
- Real macOS <-> Android video call, mac initiated and phone accepted:
  - active for roughly 4.5 minutes;
  - both sides stayed active and debug hooks remained responsive;
  - media counters continued growing (`mac_recv` reached about 18k,
    `phone_recv` about 23.6k);
  - macOS RSS rose from about 572 MiB to the 753-769 MiB band, then oscillated
    there instead of running away toward the previous 45 GB failure;
  - `/tmp/veil_media_diag.log` showed normal send/capture logs and no inbound
    overload drops or `Stop()` timeout;
  - hangup completed cleanly and both sides returned `call:null`.
- Local checks passed:
  - `flutter analyze lib/state/veil_call_media.dart lib/state/call_service.dart third_party/veil/flutter/veil_flutter/lib/src/client.dart`
  - `flutter test test/call_service_test.dart test/durable_redrive_test.dart`
  - `cargo check -p veilclient-ffi --features node-embedded,production-seeds`
  - `cargo test -p veilclient-ffi --features node-embedded,production-seeds media_priority_tests --lib`
  - `WEBRTC_SRC=~/Projects/veilnetwork/webrtc-checkout/src WEBRTC_OUT=out/mac-arm64 ./build_veil_media_dylib.sh`
  - `cargo build -p veilclient-ffi --features node-embedded,production-seeds --release`
  - `flutter build macos --debug`

## Open bugs

### 1. Real bidirectional video call memory leak

Status after the 2026-07-09 follow-up: not reproduced in a roughly 4.5 minute
real macOS <-> Android video call after bounding the native inbound shim queue.
The macOS process stabilized around 753-769 MiB RSS and hung up cleanly. Keep
this section until Android `libveil_media.so` is rebuilt and a longer soak has
confirmed the same behavior.

Original symptom: during a real macOS <-> Android video call, the macOS `xveil`
process grew to roughly 45 GB RAM and became unresponsive under swap pressure.

Ruled out so far:

- media stale-route self-heal drain loop: flat RSS while blasting dropping
  datagrams to an unreachable peer.
- Dart remote video renderer: coalesces decode work and disposes `ui.Image`.
- C++ receive sink keeps only the latest RGBA frame in a reusable vector.
- Dart `getVideoFrame` reuses its frame buffer and frees width/height pointers.
- audio-only calls and synthetic video send do not show runaway growth.

Prime suspect before the follow-up: native `libveil_media` under real phone
camera receive/decode, especially an unbounded inbound datagram handoff into
WebRTC's network queue when decode/network processing lagged live media.

Next step if it returns: reproduce with a real video call and
`MallocStackLogging=1`, capture `heap <pid>` and
`malloc_history <pid> -allBySize` at about 2.5-3 GB RSS, then kill the process
before macOS reaches global memory pressure.

### 2. Low-RSS Flutter UI isolate freeze in synchronous FFI

Symptom: separate freeze at about 0.49 GB RSS, low CPU, app/debug hook
unresponsive. `sample` showed the main thread in Dart JIT frames, a synchronous
veil FFI call, `tokio::runtime::Runtime::block_on`, and `parking_lot` condvar
wait. The nearest symbol was `veil_get_node_id`, but the offset may point to a
nearby function.

Most likely pattern: a call/media-start path still invokes a blocking Rust FFI
operation from the Flutter UI isolate.

Primary places to inspect:

- `lib/state/veil_call_media.dart`, especially `VeilCallMediaController.start()`.
- `third_party/veil/flutter/veil_flutter/lib/src/client.dart` for wrappers that
  should use `Isolate.run` instead of direct synchronous FFI.
- `third_party/veil/crates/veilclient-ffi/src/lib.rs` and `anon_stream.rs` for
  FFI functions that call `Runtime::block_on`.

Useful already-committed fix in veil: `554b053` runs node id FFI off the Flutter
UI isolate. Continue looking for other synchronous media/open-channel calls.

Local follow-up after that commit: `AppHandle.send()` was also moved off-isolate,
because call offer/answer/health signaling uses the ordinary messaging send path
and `veil_send` also `block_on`s. In the 2026-07-09 real video call, the debug
hooks remained responsive throughout the run, so the low-RSS freeze did not
reproduce in that pass. If it returns, confirm with `sample` that the main
thread no longer parks inside `libveilclient_ffi`.

The stale-route self-heal commit `45061b5` is a possible A/B test candidate if
deadlocks persist, because its drain task can re-enter media channel opening and
async mutexes.

## Repro and safety notes

- Use debug builds with release native libs, launched from Terminal with
  `MallocStackLogging=1`.
- Keep a safety monitor that captures allocator state and kills the process at
  2.5-4.5 GB RSS. Do not let the real leak run to 45 GB again.
- Debug hook ports:
  - macOS: `http://127.0.0.1:38765`
  - Android via adb forward: `http://127.0.0.1:38766`
- Unlock both with POST body `111111`, then use `/wait_ready`, `/identity`,
  `/call_place?peer=<hex>&media=video`, `/call_accept`, `/call_hangup`,
  `/call_state`, `/media_open`, `/media_send`, and `/media_recv_count`.
- On macOS, ad-hoc re-signing resets Camera/Microphone TCC for the bundle id;
  reset/grant permissions before a real video repro.
