# xVeil architecture

xVeil is a cross-platform (Android · iOS · Windows · Linux · macOS) Flutter client
for the [veil](https://github.com/veilnetwork/veil) overlay network. It is
**messenger-first**: a Telegram-grade chat experience whose primary differentiator
is decentralization and deniability. Proxy/VPN routing and node management are
secondary surfaces. Cloud file storage is shipped, not planned — its own screens,
folder sync, a trash with undo, and per-folder ACLs.

It is built for people in censored / authoritarian environments. The two design
rules that follow from that — minimal user actions, and no central source of data —
shape every decision below.

## Ports & adapters

Every external dependency sits behind a **port** (a Dart `abstract interface`) with
**both a real adapter and an in-memory fake**. The fakes let the whole app build/run/test
without the native Rust stack; selecting real vs fake is a provider choice in
`lib/state/providers.dart` (+ `main()` bootstrap). All three real adapters are
implemented and verified end-to-end.

| Port | File | Real adapter | Fake (dev/tests) |
|------|------|--------------|------------------|
| `Storage` | `lib/data/storage/` | `HiddenVolumeStorage` over `hidden_volume` (deniable container; `HvKvLogStore`) | `HiddenVolumeStorage` over `FakeKvLogStore` |
| `NodeController` | `lib/data/node/` | `EmbeddedNodeController` (node in-process via FFI) **or** `SubprocessNodeController` (`veil-cli node run`) | `FakeNodeController` |
| `VeilTransport` | `lib/data/transport/` | `VeilFlutterTransport` (`veil_flutter` `VeilClient`/`AppHandle`, `xveil/inbox` endpoint) | `LoopbackTransport` (echoes) |

`RealVeilStack` (`lib/data/veil_stack.dart`) composes the real node + transport + this
device's bootstrap invite; `main()` activates it when `XVEIL_VEIL_CLI`/`XVEIL_VEIL_CONFIG`
are set (`XVEIL_NODE_MODE=embedded` picks the in-process node), else the app stays on fakes.

```
UI (features/*)  ──►  Riverpod state (state/*)  ──►  Ports (data/*)  ──►  fake | native
                         AppController                Storage
                         MessagingService             NodeController
                                                      VeilTransport
```

## Key decisions

1. **Node runtime — embedded or subprocess (both done).** The veil client FFI only
   *connects* to a running node. xVeil starts one two ways behind `NodeController`:
   `SubprocessNodeController` spawns `veil-cli node run` (desktop/Android); the
   **embedded** path runs the node IN-PROCESS via a new `veil_node_start/stop` FFI
   (`node-embedded` feature in `veilclient-ffi`) — required for iOS and sandboxed
   desktop (no subprocess), and verified end-to-end. The embedded build drops RocksDB
   (in-memory DHT) so mobile stays slim.
2. **Storage — hidden-volume.** Default is a deniable hidden space; plain storage is an
   explicit, warned opt-in. A **master vault** (`MasterVault`) that unlocks several
   child spaces with one password is an app-layer construct (the library does 1
   password → 1 space). `loadConversations` derives from a contacts index + the message
   log (hidden-volume has no KV key enumeration).
3. **Consent gate.** Strangers can't message unsolicited: a typed `WireEnvelope`
   carries request/accept/message; a relationship is `pending → accepted` before free
   messaging (`MessagingService`; `ContactStatus`). Messages from non-accepted/blocked
   peers are dropped.
4. **Fakes-first.** The fakes keep the whole app build/run/test-able without the native
   stack; the real stack is verified by env-gated tests under `test/native/`.

## State & navigation

- **Riverpod** for DI and state. `AppController` exposes an `AppPhase`
  (`bootstrapping → onboarding | locked → ready`).
- **go_router** gates navigation on `AppPhase` via a redirect bridged from Riverpod.
- **MessagingService** is the single seam where `VeilTransport` meets `Storage`:
  inbound payloads are persisted then surfaced; `sendText` persists then transmits.

## Status

**Done & verified:** native storage (deniable container on desktop); node lifecycle
(subprocess **and** embedded in-process FFI); pure-Dart BLAKE3 → `app_id`/`node_id`;
real transport (`send`/`messages`); **two-node real chat**; bootstrap-invite contact
exchange (QR + paste); `RealVeilStack` composition; consent gate (request/accept);
`MasterVault`; recovery-phrase input; app icons; lock-screen "start over" recovery.
Test harness: ~5,700 tests in 566 files. Live cases in `test/native/` and
`test/e2e/` skip under a plain `flutter test` when their native libraries are
missing; the multi-device harness also needs a `veil-cli` from the same build.
`.github/workflows/nightly.yml` builds these artifacts and schedules the
locally runnable live cases, while the push CI covers the regular Dart suite.

**Shipped since this section was written** — each was roadmap here, each is wired into
the app rather than merely present as a file:

- Veil FFI follow-ups: `veil_config_init` and `apply_config` (deferred mode) are bound
  and called from `RealVeilStack`; iOS dylib bundling is `scripts/build-mobile.sh ios`, TCP-loopback IPC is in `embedded_node.dart`.
- Identity restore/import, via `veil_config_init_from_phrase`.
- Username claiming — rarity-proportional PoW through `veil_flutter`
  (`claimNickname`/`resolveNickname`), UI in `features/settings/nickname_screen.dart`.
- Multi-device pairing (`device_link_invite`), mailbox offline delivery
  (`mailbox_service` + `mailbox_orchestrator`).
- File / image / video transfer (`messaging_file_transfer`).
- Audio / video calls (`call_service`, `group_call_service`). New video starts at 45 kbit/s at 1 fps on direct calls (30 kbit/s at 1 fps on anonymous/group calls), then grows one rung per 12 healthy audio samples with known RTT. Missing, expired or stalled audio feedback cannot increase video. Rebuilding the same unicast call/profile retains its video budget and hysteresis; the new native encoder starts at that budget. Desired microphone state belongs to the call, survives media-engine recreation and asynchronous opening, and is cleared on final hangup. Reusing an older call snapshot cannot undo a mute chosen during the call; cancelled or replaced opening remains muted.
- Built-in S3-style object storage across identities (`cloud_*`).
- Proxy/VPN (oproxy/ogate), SSH node provisioning.

Loaded-call check (Android debug 2150, 2026-10-04): both cellular/Wi-Fi phone
video calls remained active for at least 85 seconds. One concurrent 8 MiB file
completed in 28.1 seconds with matching SHA-256; the second download API returned
504 after its 45-second observation deadline, without a verified exported file.
During the verified transfer the receiver's median native audio playout estimate
rose from 272 to 472 ms (peak 631 ms), and stayed elevated afterwards. RTP counts
continued increasing; this does not establish acoustic quality. Two observed
Poco QUIC sessions advertised no opaque flows, independent transport or circuit
datagrams. These sessions cannot provide the new connection split; their exact
mapping to the call route is not yet established. Loaded-link audio quality and
actual end-to-end transport separation remain open, beyond local queue tests.

Ordered compatibility transport now bounds this endpoint's bulk write-ahead
while its own primary producer was active within three seconds: normally one
4 KiB padded batch may wait behind the writer, with a whole-frame exception for
an oversized individual frame. The writer wakes the runner when the required
slots become available; progress does not depend on another inbound frame or
keepalive. This cannot recall bytes already committed to the transport/kernel.
Transit retains its normal WRR/FIFO, batching and capacity; no transport label
or relay service preference is added. The encrypted, uniformly paced stream
regression fails without admission (133,808 bytes ahead of the next primary),
passes with less than 16 KiB, and verifies all 64 reliable payloads in order.
Gates: 96 runner integration tests passed (one ignored), 23 queue tests and
four admission tests passed.

Phone check (Android debug 2151, 2026-10-05): both video directions stayed active
for 85 seconds, with ring/active times 5.7/8.9 and 3.1/5.0 seconds. The two
60-second file observations timed out with zero exported bytes. A control file
without a call completed with matching SHA-256 in 74 seconds. A longer video
call remained active for 150 seconds; its 8 MiB file completed and verified in
104 seconds, with the first positive export sample 80 seconds after requesting
the download. The sender logged 23 stream authorization denials naming a
device different from the accepted contact identity, and no successful stream
serve for that CID; the device-owner authorization path needs investigation.
During observed verified-file progress, median native playout estimates were
137/218 ms (Blackview/Poco), peaks 362/460 ms; other phases exceeded 500 ms.
These estimates and continuing RTP do not establish acoustic quality or a
controlled improvement. This last ring took 19 seconds. Local first-send
diagnostics finally observed relay forwards in source slots 0 and 2 on shared
QUIC DATAGRAM sessions, all with `independent=false`; separate source transport
is not established on those hops. Signaling latency and audio quality remain
open. The authenticated debug hook provides CID-scoped download cancellation
and pending IDs so stands can cancel their own retry jobs before cleanup.
The cleanup exposed a cancellation race: a suspended resume could re-record
durable intent after cancellation. Recording now checks the cancellation latch
both before scheduling and inside the persistence chain. A gated-storage test
fails before the fix and verifies cancellation across restart plus a fresh user
retry afterwards; all six auto-resume tests pass.

**Not built:**
- Remote push. Notifications are local-only (`flutter_local_notifications`): the
  notification layer displays what the caller hands it and holds no policy, and there
  is no FCM/APNs registration anywhere in `lib/`. A sleeping device stays asleep until
  it wakes and drains its mailbox on its own.
- The Lua extension VM. The ARB strings are kept (`networkExtTitle`) and the row was
  taken out of the network screen, because a chevron leading to a "coming later"
  snackbar reads as a feature that exists and is merely switched off.

See `doc/SECURITY-NOTES.md` for the threat-model constraints these features inherit.
